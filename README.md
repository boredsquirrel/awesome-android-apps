Recommended modern, useful Android Apps

Use [Obtainium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium/releases/latest) for installing the Apps, it is really great.

For discovering Apps, I recommend:
- [F-Droid Basic](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.fdroid.basic/)
  - you can add [all these repos](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/wiki/-/wikis/List-of-F-Droid-repositories) for discovering new apps
  - copy the repo URL to Obtainium, in F-Droid basic share the App link, use the `org.app.name` in Obtainium to download the correct appa
  - example: [DivestOS Official repo](https://divestos.org/apks/official/fdroid/repo), `us.spotco.fennec_dos`
  - Often you can just copy the "source URL" to Obtainium and it will get the official releases

For getting proprietary apps:
- use Shelter and setup a work profile, to isolate hostile apps
- clone Obtainium to that work profile
- Use [APKPure](https://apkpure.com) or [Aptoide](https://aptoide.com), long press the app's name in the search, and copy the link to Obtainium
- Use AuroraStore or Sandboxed PlayStore to get the latest and official releases
- **Sharing is caring**: use "[APK Kit](https://github.com/ghmxr/apkextractor)" to extract the APKs and upload them to APKPure
